# AWAKE

### *Computers that don’t reboot. They wake.*

##  What is AWAKE?

**AWAKE** is an experimental system-level project that rethinks how computers start, stop, and recover.

Instead of treating power-off as *death* and power-on as a *cold rebirth*, AWAKE treats computing as a **continuous state** — where systems pause, persist, and resume instantly.

The goal is simple:

> **Make laptops feel alive, not rebooted.**

No waiting.
No cold starts.


##  The Core Idea

Traditional computers follow this cycle:

```
Power Off → Boot → Load OS → Load Apps → Ready
```

AWAKE replaces this with:

```
Pause → Persist → Wake → Resume → Ready
```

From the user’s perspective:

* Press power → screen is usable almost instantly
* The system resumes intelligently in the background
* Crashes and power loss recover gracefully

This is not just “faster boot”.
It’s **a different philosophy of computing**.



##  CONTINUUM — The Architecture Behind AWAKE

**CONTINUUM** is the architectural foundation of AWAKE.

> **Computing should be continuous, not episodic.**

Key principles:

* System state is checkpointed incrementally
* Persistence is crash-safe and atomic
* Resume is preferred over reboot
* UI is restored first, everything else loads lazily
* Reliability beats raw speed

CONTINUUM is inspired by:

* OS kernels
* Databases
* Journaling filesystems
* Persistent memory research



##  How It Works ( At the High-Level)

### On shutdown or idle:

* The system creates **incremental snapshots** of its state
* Only changed memory pages are stored
* A tiny **wake map** (KB-scale) is updated last

### On power-on:

* Firmware checks for a valid wake map
* The kernel resumes instead of booting
* UI becomes available immediately
* The rest of the system rehydrates in the background

Result:

> **Sub-150 ms perceived wake time on real hardware.**



## 🧩 Key Components

* **Snapshot Store**
  Full system state stored in a reserved NVMe region

* **Wake Map**
  Tiny persistent metadata (targeting FRAM eventually)

* **Resume-First Firmware Path**
  Resume is attempted before cold boot

* **UI-First Restore**
  Human-perceived speed > raw completion speed

* **Crash-Resilient Checkpointing**
  Safe even during sudden power loss



##  Multi-User & Security Model

* Kernel state may persist
* User sessions **never resume without authentication**
* Per-user snapshots are encrypted
* Secure fallback to cold boot is always available

Security is treated as a **first-class requirement**, not an afterthought.



##  Current Status

 **Early design & research phase**

Right now, this repository documents:

* The architecture
* Design decisions
* Trade-offs
* Learning process
* Experiments (eventually)

Implementation will begin incrementally on:

* Linux
* An old HP laptop (sacrificial test system)

Nothing is rushed.
Everything is documented.



##  Dark Horse Log

This project is being built as a **Dark Horse** journey.

Not a startup pitch.
Not a hype demo.
A slow, honest, documented exploration.

Every failure, rethink, and breakthrough will be logged in the *Dark Horse*.

> *Great systems aren’t rushed. They’re understood.*



##  Why This Exists

Booting is a relic of old assumptions:

* Volatile memory
* Slow storage
* Stateless machines

Those assumptions no longer hold.

AWAKE asks a simple question:

> *What if computers never really “turned off”?*



##  Roadmap (High-Level)

* [ ] Study & document Linux boot/resume internals
* [ ] Prototype snapshot + wake map (emulated FRAM)
* [ ] Achieve UI-first resume
* [ ] Add crash-safe incremental checkpointing
* [ ] Introduce external FRAM hardware
* [ ] Publish benchmarks & demos



##  Contributing / Following Along

This project is open by design.

If you’re interested in:

* Operating systems
* Firmware
* Computer architecture
* Persistent memory
* Or just *making computers feel better to use*

Feel free to follow, read, and discuss.



## 🧠 Final Note

AWAKE is not about speed alone.

It’s about **continuity**.

> Computers shouldn’t feel like machines that restart.
> They should feel like minds that wake up.
