## What are *power rails*?

**Power rails are controlled electricity lines on the motherboard** that deliver **specific voltages** to different parts of the system.

Think of your motherboard like a city.

* Electricity = water <br>
* Power rails = **separate pipelines** <br>
* Each neighborhood needs **different pressure**

You don’t blast the whole city with one giant pipe.

## Why we need multiple power rails

Different components need **different voltages** and **different timing**.

Examples:

| Component | Typical Voltage               |
| --------- | ----------------------------- |
| CPU core  | ~1.0 – 1.3 V                  |
| RAM       | ~1.2 V (DDR4) / ~1.1 V (DDR5) |
| SSD       | 3.3 V                         |
| USB       | 5 V                           |
| Fans      | 12 V                          |
| GPU       | multiple rails (very picky)   |

If you sent **12V directly to the CPU** →  instant death.

So instead:

* Each component gets its **own rail**
* Each rail is carefully regulated

## What actually *is* a rail physically?

A power rail is:

* Copper traces on the motherboard
* Connected to voltage regulators (VRMs)
* Switched on/off by the **power controller**

It’s not software.
It’s **pure hardware**.

## What happens when you press the power button?

This is the important sequence:

### Step-by-step

1. 🔘 You press the power button
2. 🧠 The **power controller** wakes up
3. ⚡ It starts enabling **power rails in order**
4. ⏱️ Each rail stabilizes (milliseconds)
5. ✅ Only then is the CPU released from reset

Order matters a LOT.

## Why order matters (this is critical)

You **cannot** do this:

CPU ON → RAM OFF <br>
CPU ON → unstable voltage <br>
RAM ON → controller OFF

Because:

* CPU expects RAM to exist
* RAM expects [clock signals](https://github.com/Pranxvv-v/AWAKE/blob/25801e81732d5411e72682e2491c4452a25393ca/docs/Dark_Horse/Explain/Clock_Signals.md)
* Clock generators expect stable power

So the power controller does something like:

```
1. 3.3V rail ON (basic logic)
2. 5V rail ON (controllers)
3. RAM rail ON
4. Clock stable
5. CPU core rail ON
6. CPU reset released
```

Only after **all rails are stable** does execution begin.

## How long does this take?

Surprisingly little - but not zero.

* Per rail: microseconds → milliseconds
* Total sequence: **~10–50 ms**

This is the **hard lower bound** for waking any computer.

No OS trick can remove this.

## Why this matters for AWAKE (big insight)

AWAKE **does not fight power rails**.

Instead:

* It accepts this cost
* It eliminates everything *after* it

So instead of:

```
Power rails → Firmware → Bootloader → Kernel → Services → UI
```

You aim for:

```
Power rails → Minimal firmware → Resume → UI
```

That’s where the “nitros” feeling comes from

## One-line intuition (remember this)

> **Power rails are the reason computers can’t wake up at absolute zero time.**

They’re the **physics tax** you must pay.

Everything else is design choice.

## Why phones feel faster

Phones:

* Have fewer rails
* Fixed hardware
* Aggressive power integration
* No legacy support

Laptops/desktops:

* Modular
* Backward compatible
* More rails
* More safety checks

AWAKE is about bringing **phone-like continuity** without breaking PC flexibility.
